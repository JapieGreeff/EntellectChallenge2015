# EntellectChallenge2015
This was the modifications I made to the standard node bot for the 2015 entellect challenge. Original code is all available from here:
https://github.com/EntelectChallenge/2015-SpaceInvaders-Bot-NodeJS
To run my bot, just replace the main.js file in the sample bot with the one from this repository - everything else will then work exactly the same as it does with the sample bot.
